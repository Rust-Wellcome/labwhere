# Labwhere

This is a rebuild of [Sanger Labwhere](https://github.com/sanger/labwhere)

It is a proof of concept:
- Service only (no User Interface)
- Will it be faster?
- Will it be cleaner?
- Will it be less buggy and clunky?
- Can we build a better API? Rails support for Json API and GraphQL is average and difficult to maintain.
